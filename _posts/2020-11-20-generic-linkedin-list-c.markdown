Linked <- - -> List is one of the most widely used `data structure` in the Linux system implementation. It holds special importance in the process scheduling.

We will discuss how Linux use generic `Linked List` and optimise the process
scheduling given the nature of `Linked List`.

In this post we will demistify how Doubley Circular Linked list is implemented in the
Linux Kernel and how scheduler has optimised Run Queue.

[WIP]
